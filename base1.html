              Video games have become one of the most popular forms of entertainment around the world. Currently, agents (bots or non-player characters) are predominantly programmed using procedural and deterministic imperative techniques, which pose significant drawbacks in terms of cost and time efficiency. An interesting and alternative line of work is to develop declarative scripting languages which align the programming task closer to human logic. This allows programmers to intuitively implement agents‚Äô behaviors using straightforward rules. In this regard, most of these languages are interpreted, which may impact performance. Hence, this article presents the design and implementation of a new declarative and compiled scripting language called Obelysk for controlling agents. To test and evaluate the language, a video game was created using the Godot game engine, which allowed us to demonstrate the correct functionality of our scripting language to program the AIs participating in the video game. Finally, an analytics platform was also developed to evaluate the correct behavior of the programmed agents.

              This study was conducted to investigate the effect of digital parenting attitudes on digital game addiction in middle school students. Nurses can provide support to parents and students to reduce the risk of digital game addiction in children. Methods: Cross-sectional design was used in this study. The study was conducted in a middle school in X. The sample of the study consisted of 306 students and 306 parents. A ‚ÄúPersonal Information Form,‚Äù the ‚ÄúDigital Parenting Attitude Scale,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDigital Game Addiction Scale for Children‚Äù were used to collect data. Results: The rate of playing digital games was 83% among the students, and 24,8% played digital games for an average of an hour a day. Parents" mean score on the ‚ÄúDigital Parenting Attitude Scale‚Äù was 46,97 ¬± 6,27. Students" mean score on the ‚ÄúDigital Game Addiction Scale‚Äù was 59,42 ¬± 19,39. When the students were evaluated according to their digital game addiction levels, it was determined that 14,4% of them were ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù, 2,6% were ‚Äúhighly addicted‚Äù, and 54,9% were in the ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù group. No significant relationship was found between the scales (p > 0,05). Conclusion: There was no significant correlation between scales. However, it was found that the majority of the students were digital game addicts or in the risk group. It is recommended that the necessary interventions be planned in cooperation with parents so that students can maintain healthy digital game playing behaviors and receive protective and preventive training to prevent digital game addiction. ¬© (2025), (Escola de Enfermagem de Universidade de Sao Paulo).

              The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased interest in home-cooked meals as people have had more time for themselves and their families. Cooking at home is considered safer and has resulted in a significant rise in the number of people preparing their own food. Only 7.0 percent cooked less frequently during the lockdown, while 42.0 percent cooked more frequently. Women were particularly affected by this trend. More time was spent on meal preparation, trying new recipes, and baking among those who cooked more often. The consumption of comfort foods like sweets and salty snacks has seen a notable increase, with a significant percentage of respondents reporting increased snacking. Unfortunately, this change in eating habits, combined with reduced physical activity, has raised concerns about weight gain. To address the growing interest in home cooking and the need for new recipes and balanced meals, the idea for a cooking app called ‚ÄúCooking Papa‚Äù has been proposed. This app aims to simplify home-cooked meals by providing clear instructions and encouraging users to explore new dishes in its database. The definition of cooking varies among individuals, and terms like homemade, convenience, proper cooking, cook, basic ingredients, and ready prepared are not universally understood. Cooking is seen as a complex concept, influenced by factors like heat, fresh ingredients, and convenience meals. While convenience foods are popular, scratch cooking is highly valued. Lack of time and cost are major obstacles, and effective meal planning and organization are essential. Disruptive events like the pandemic can change people‚Äôs perspectives on cooking. Most individuals tend to remain in their current state, with some shifting towards more positive or negative views on shopping and cooking. Those most impacted by the pandemic are at a higher risk of transitioning between states. Overall, the pandemic has prompted some individuals to rediscover their love for home cooking and home-cooked meals.
